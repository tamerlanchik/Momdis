% INPMODEL M-file for inpmodel.fig
%      INPMODEL, by itself, creates a new INPMODEL or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = INPMODEL returns the handle to a new INPMODEL or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      INPMODEL('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in INPMODEL.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      INPMODEL('Property','Value',...) creates a new INPMODEL or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before inpmodel_OpeningFunction gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to inpmodel_OpeningFcn via varargin.
